# STARBUCKS-SALES-ANALYSIS-USING-MYSQL


## Overview
This project presents a detailed sales analysis of Starbucks, leveraging MySQL as the foundational tool for data management and querying. The core objective is to extract actionable insights from a comprehensive sales dataset, enabling a deeper understanding of customer behavior and market dynamics. Through meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by targeted SQL queries, this project identifies key sales trends, product performance, and the impact of various factors on revenue. This data-driven investigation aims to provide Starbucks with quantifiable intelligence to optimize its strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and drive continued success in the competitive global beverage industry.

## History of Starbucks
Starbucks began its journey in 1971 in Seattle's historic Pike Place Market, founded by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker. Initially, it sold high-quality whole bean coffee, tea, and spices, inspired by the Dutch coffee entrepreneur Alfred Peet. The name "Starbucks" was drawn from the first mate in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, evoking the romance of early coffee traders. The pivotal shift from a bean retailer to the globally recognized coffeehouse chain occurred in the 1980s, largely due to Howard Schultz. After being captivated by the vibrant espresso bar culture during a trip to Milan, Schultz envisioned Starbucks as a "third place" â€“ a welcoming space between home and work. Despite initial resistance from the founders, Schultz eventually acquired Starbucks in 1987, rapidly expanding its presence and transforming it into the coffee giant known worldwide today, synonymous with a premium coffee experience and community gathering.

## Introduction
This repository contains the SQL scripts and findings from a comprehensive sales analysis project on Starbucks. The analysis was performed using MySQL to process and query a sales dataset, focusing on extracting meaningful business intelligence.

## Key Analysis Questions & Insights
This project addressed several critical business questions to derive actionable insights:

1.Total number of transactions for each product 

2.List of product names and their total sales quantity 

3.Identification of the top 5 products by revenue 

4.Calculation of total revenue for each payment method 

5.Sales statistics for each product category 

6.Performance metrics analyzed by store location 

7.Identification of products with unit prices above the average price 

8.Identification of products that generated revenue above the average product revenue 

9.Retrieval of all transactions from the day with the highest total sales 

10.Ranking of products by their total revenue with running totals 

11.Analysis of daily sales patterns to identify growth or decline trends 

12.Categorization of daily sales performance as high, average, or low compared to overall statistics 

13.Comprehensive product analysis including sales volume, revenue, category share, and performance classification 

14.Identification of hours of the day that generate the highest sales volume and revenue 

(Detailed insights and visualizations for each of these questions are available in the Starbucks Analysis.pptx file.)
