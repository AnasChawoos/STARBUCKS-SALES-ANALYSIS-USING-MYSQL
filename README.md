Starbucks began its journey in 1971 in Seattle's historic Pike Place Market, founded by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker. Initially, it sold high-quality whole bean coffee, tea, and spices, inspired by the Dutch coffee entrepreneur Alfred Peet. The name "Starbucks" was drawn from the first mate in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, evoking the romance of early coffee traders. The pivotal shift from a bean retailer to the globally recognized coffeehouse chain occurred in the 1980s, largely due to Howard Schultz. After being captivated by the vibrant espresso bar culture during a trip to Milan, Schultz envisioned Starbucks as a "third place" â€“ a welcoming space between home and work. Despite initial resistance from the founders, Schultz eventually acquired Starbucks in 1987, rapidly expanding its presence and transforming it into the coffee giant known worldwide today, synonymous with a premium coffee experience and community gathering.
